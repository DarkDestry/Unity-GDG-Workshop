# Chapter 8 - Building the game

In this chapter we will be building the game into a separate executable

## Saving the scene

The scene that you have been working on needs to be saved into a file that will be loaded when the game launches. To do that select `File > Save` at the menu bar to save the scene. If this is your first time saving, you should be prompted where to save the scene. Create a folder in your assets directory called `Scenes` and save it in there.

# Building the game

To build the game, Navigate to the build settings at `File > Build Settings` on the menu bar. Alternatively you can press `Ctrl-Shift-B`. Ensure that the scene is selected on the scenes list and the approprate platform is selected. Finally hit `Build and Run` and you will be prompted for a build directory. Create a folder named `Builds` and select that folder.

Your game should launch and you can find the binary files in the folder you specified.
