# Chapter 3 - Player Movement

In this chapter we will be creating a movable player ship.

## Creating the Player

To start, you need a player ship in the game scene. Navigate to the `Sprites/Ships` folder in your project explorer. Select a ship and drag it into the scene view.

## Scripting the Player

For this workshop we have packaged all the assets you need for the game into one unity package. You can get the .unitypackage [here](https://github.com/DarkDestry/Unity-GDG-Workshop/releases/tag/1.0.1). Under Assets, Workshop-pack-2.unitypackage.

Open the .unitypackage file and you will see an import package window. Ensure all items are checked and click import. Wait for the import to finish and you should see the assets in your project explorer.
