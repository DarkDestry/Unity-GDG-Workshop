# Chapter 2 - Background

In this chapter we will be creating a background for the game

## Creating the background

The game needs an interesting background to place the player in the world. To add a background to the game we simply need to find the image and drag it into the scene view.

Navigate to `Sprites/Background` and pick a background for your game. Click and drag it to the Hierarchy to add it.

On your scene view and game view, you should be able to see the background that you have just added.

## Making the background scroll

However, our game is about a ship traving through an asteroid field. Having a static background looks like the ship is not moving. To give an illusion of movement, we will make the background scroll.

To do this, we need to create ourselves a new material.
